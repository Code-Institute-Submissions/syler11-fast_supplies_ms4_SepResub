## Surface

### Color palette
There are six main colors what I used throughout of this project.
- #555 - The main font colour throughpout the site apart from the main navigation
- #6c757d - Light grey colour for muted text like product categories
- #ececec - footer background colour
- #000 - Banner and some of the buttons back ground colour and navigation font color
- #00008B - Bag colour
- #007bff - Edit icon color
- #dc3545 - Delete icon color

I choose those colours after testing a number of palettes while making sure the colour palette met accessibility standards.
![Color Palette](media/ms4_colour_palette.png)

### Typography
The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. This font is from the Google fonts library.

# Features

The website have 9 distinct features, and they are described below
What is important to detail is what pages are accessible by the three types of users
1. A  guest user not logged into the site
2. A regular user logged into the site
3. A superuser
The navigation buttons update depending on whether a user is logged in or not, and whether that user is the admin:

# Deployment
There are several applications that need to be configured to run this application locally or on a cloud based service.


## AWS Amazon Webservices 

To deploy this application to Heroku, run the following steps. ( source CI - boutique-ado tutorial)
1. Create an account at heroku.com
2. Create an app, give it a name for example fast-suuplies, and select a region (EU)
3. Under resources search for postgres, and add a Postgres database to the app
4. Note the DATABASE_URL, this can be set as an environment variable in Heroku and your local deployment(env.py)
5. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2-binary.
6. Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so both are added to the requirements.txt file
7. Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn rugby_shop.wsgi:application for example
8. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the Heroku postgres database
9. Ensure debug is set to false in the settings.py file
10. Add localhost/127.0.0.1, and fast-supplies.herokuapp.com to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py
11. Run "python3 manage.py showmigrations" to check the status of the migrations
12. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to migrate the database
13. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user
14. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata categories.json" on the categories file in products/fixtures to create the categories
15. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata products.json" on the products file in products/fixtures to create the products
16. Install gunicorn and add it to the requirements.tx file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
17. From the CLI login to Heroku using the command heroku git:remote -a fast-supplies
18. Disable collectstatic in Heroku before any code is pushed using the command heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 -a fast-supplies
19. Push the code to Heroku using the command git push heroku master
20. Ensure the following environment variables are set in Heroku
21. Since Heroku disabled GitHub auto deployment use the following step
22. <code>heroku login -i</code> (add email address and password)
23. once logged in use <code>heroku git:remote -a fast-supplies</code>
24. <code>git push heroku main</code>  
22. Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time
23. Click on the link provided to access the application
24. If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue
